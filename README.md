## 📚 What is a Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest known encryption techniques.  
It works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a certain number of steps.  
For example, shifting `A` by 3 gives you `D`.

## 🚀 Features

-   🔁 Encrypt or decrypt messages
-   🧮 Customizable shift values
-   💬 Interactive Command Line Interface (CLI)
-   🔤 Preserves letter casing and ignores special characters

---

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the script in a terminal:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
```

3. Follow the prompts :

-   Choose a mode: `encrypt` or `decrypt`
-   Enter the text you want to process
-   Enter a shift number (an integer, e.g.3)

The tool will output the result immediately.

## Example

```bash
🔐 Caesar Cipher Tool
Choose mode (encrypt/decrypt): encrypt
Enter the text: Hello World!
Enter the shift number (e.g. 3): 3

Result: Khoor Zruog!
```

## 🧪 Example

-   Encrypting "abc" with a shift of 2 will give: "cde"
-   Decrypting "cde" with a shift of 2 will return: "abc"

## 📄 File Structure

```bash
📁 Caesar_Cipher/
└── Caesar_Cipher.py
```

## 🧠 Learnings

This small project covers:

-   Loops (for)

-   Conditionals (if/else)

-   ASCII operations with ord() and chr()

-   Command-line input with input()

-   Defensive programming with basic error handling
